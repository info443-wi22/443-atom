# INFO 443 Project - Atom
_by Yilin Chen, Jossie Choi, Debbie Dai and Stephan Rubalcava_

## Brief Description
### What is the software system, and what does it do? Give a short (a few sentences is fine) explanation from a user/consumer perspective.
Atom is a text editor that is unique in that it supports markdown and javascript plugins. These allow for users to do much more than conventional text editors. It also enables user to work directly with Git(create new branches, stage and commit, push and pull, resolve merge conflicts and more) and Github.
   
### Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it? 
The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. This project is maintained by their community, with an upwards of 400+ contributors that are active to this day.
