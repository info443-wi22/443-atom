_by Yilin Chen, Jossie Choi, Debbie Dai and Stephan Rubalcava_

## Brief Description
### What is the software system, and what does it do?
Atom is a text editor that is unique in that it supports markdown and javascript plugins. These allow for users to do much more than conventional text editors. It also enables user to work directly with Git(create new branches, stage and commit, push and pull, resolve merge conflicts and more) and Github.
   
### Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it? 
 Developed by GitHub, Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. This project is maintained by their community, with an upwards of 400+ contributors that are active to this day.
